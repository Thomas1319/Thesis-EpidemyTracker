hello doctor, i am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. at that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. two days later, i consulted with a doctor. he prescribed cavidur 625, montek lc, ambrolite syrup and betaline gargle solution. since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. from yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree celcius). i have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. in our state, there is no incidence of covid-19. please suggest what to do?
thank you doctor,after doing all these i can upload all for further query.
thank you doctor,as per your guidelines, i have made one test. due to city shutdown, i could not able to make an x-ray of chest. fever is coming every 12 hours. but cough does not persist currently. the only problem is a fever. i am uploading the blood examination report. please advice.

hello doctor,i am a 23-year-old man. i have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. first, i wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am i to die of coronavirus.second, i have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. i always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. i also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. i did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive covid. and i quit smoking past week. down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. why am i feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? how likely am i to have covid-19? and how likely am i to die from it?
hello doctor,last night i was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like i am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. also, my heart was pumping fast. also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. i have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.i took medicines yesterday but today i got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. then today, i called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. i had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. i told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time i am feeling lightheaded. he just gives pepcid, a try maybe gerd. i ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. so, should i be worried? i do not think i have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? was it gerd or flu, it is coronavirus or something else? i hope it is not coronavirus.i am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.
thank you doctor,i travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. no airport exposure. i have not checked the temperature. i do not feel hot or anything. i have minor coughs and sore throat. yes, i have mucus which seems white or clear for now.during sleep, i do not have much aches. last night i have not got much sleep, probably because i was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.
thank you doctor,i woke up this morning, i had trouble sleeping being worried, but i got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.so far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. i only hear minor coughs the past week or so. thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. i fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.i will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. yes, i will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. and school is online. i recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. i might not need ac unless really hot.i will be staying home for the next month at least. my chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe i did not get enough sleep.i stay in san francisco ca, united states, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. no severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.so, last week i have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. any recommendations? any foods or drinks that can help?
thank you doctor,as of now 12:40 pm i am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. i only ate some breakfast and drank water.here is my story: before feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.friday february 28th - i woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. hours later was better.saturday february 29th - diarrheasunday march 1st - diarrheamonday march 2 - diarrheatuesday march 3 - diarrheawednesday march 4 - no stoolthursday march 3 - no more diarrheafriday march 4th - monday march 9th - no issuesmonday march 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throatafternoon i ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later i drank cough and flu medicine.on monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 am, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and i described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like gerd, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. he asked have you tried stronger antacids like pepcid or zantac?i said no. then doctor asked me to try pepcid and tell me how it goes.tuesday and wednesday march 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.thursday march 21 i woke up fine, then once ate pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then i counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when i counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. then shortly after, i drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. my heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.friday march 20- 10 am i woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.11 am - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.11:30 am moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.11:58 am - feeling a bit better12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.after an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.
thank you doctor,i went to the store to look for zantac they did not have it, so i talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since pepcid and zantac are the same. he said to try ranitidine.right now i tried pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes i think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, i tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. then i think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. even water makes my heart beat a little faster. should i stick with pepcid? finish the entire bottle? i think it has 20-30 pieces.i used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like i get hungry before i go to bed then i started eating snacks and lying down. sometimes i starve myself. sometimes i wake up with acid feeling in my mouth.i don't know why i woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like i had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). i then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, i started to breathe better again.could it be shortness or breath? may be blood pressure? esophagus issue? chest issue? heart issue? i am having weird breathing. should i be worried?
thank you doctor,i was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. i was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.
thank you doctor, i really appreciate your help so much. i appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. only thing i am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. i will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. i hope to get less chest issues when i wake up.
yeah if it doesn't get better laryngoscopy would be perfect. okay, i'll give it some time thank you!i try to eat vegetables and fruits. i don't eat much junk food that much. i used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. i have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. used to a lot years ago, now barely.since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. after this point high school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. when i was younger (elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.one doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.so, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.that's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.
sounds good! awesome! appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. very patient and kind!

i was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore i went back to the gp who then gave me clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. i have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. i had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as i was out of breath and wheezy. i still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. i have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if i am going backwards again instead of improving. i am 45 years old. non-smoker.this is the 3rd time i have had pneumonia in 18 years. i am reasonably fit and healthy, and i don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever i come down with something, i seem to suffer with it. how long does it take to get back to normal? are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would i need to see the gp again. i am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. i am taking a tonic (metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.

i ve had symptoms of cough, headache, stuffy nose, fatigue, and sore throat for 4 days. i know these are typical of common cold. however, once before (18 months ago), when i just tried to ride it out, i developed pneumonia and was in hospital for several days. are there any precautions i can take now to prevent this from getting complicated? thanks.

i have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. this has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. for the first 3 years of taking the medication i found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. also i found that i had next to no energy, making many things i used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. after extensive talks with my doctor i was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. i was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of delatestryl and for the past several years i have been the person that i used to be (it gave me my life back). know i have been given a new doctor at the clinic i attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. i do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. the walk in clinic treats every individual that i know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption. (to give you some perspective on our walk in clinic - i went their several mnths back with sever pneumonia and the doctor looked at my chart once and told me that i would get know %$# narcotics from him and to leave immediately) any suggestions on how to get across to my knew methadone doctor (who has only been in prescribing methadone for 2 months) just how much this would severely negatively impact my life?

i was given a steroid shot at 10am this morning when it was discovered that i have potential pneumonia. i was also proscribed an inhaler and a strong antibiotic, both of which i am now actively taking as directed. the dr offered a cough syrup with codeine for assistance with sleeping through the symptoms that have been interfering with my ability to sleep, which i declined due to being someone who never takes medications at all and fear of having so much in my system at once. the dr. clarified that nyquil would be just fine if needed and if i m more comfortable with. i m having some anticipated potential insomnia from the steroid, and some heart palpitations, and i have an irregular heart palpitations to begin with. i feel inclined to take the nyquil to ensure i get desperately needed sleep, but am concerned with all that is on board, etc. definitive guidance would be so greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!

my mother was admitted to st. jude s last wednesday with pneumonia. she is 82 and also has copd and parkinson s. she was treated with antibiotics and released four days later. she is to continue with antibiotics treatment at her skilled nursing facility for another 7 days. the day after she returned to her skilled nursing facility, she was given a new roommate who has advanced pneumonia and in critical condition. a few days earlier, the doctor at the hospital said that my mother s pneumonia was negative and she was taken out of isolation. is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?

hi, i got diagnosed with pneumonia yesterday and have been sent home with antibiotics (amoxicillin and doxycycline) i was just wondering what the risk factors would be if i were to have at least one cigarette? i know it wouldn’t be good for the healing process(will probably slow it down) but is there any serious risk with smoking (ciggerattes or maybe even weed mixed with tobacco?) my doctor at the hospital that diagnosed me knew i smoked and also knew i smoked at least one or two bongs and he said nothing when i was leaving about trying not to smoke etc etc?

my husband (age 63 and in great health) was diagnosed with strep pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital, he was released with antibiotic levaquin, after 5 days i had to bring him back to the er because he spiked a fever of 101. they discovered that the original pneumonia of the right upper lung was almost gone but it had spread to the lower lobe. they discharged him with prescriptions for azrithomycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days and amox tr-k clv 875-125 twice a day for 10 days. the amox is making him very nauseated and he gets headaches from it. can he stop taking it after 7 days instead of 10? generally he is feeling better, no fever since beginning the two antibiotic combination?

name: brentage: 22sex: malesymptoms : i have a cough that seems to be reccursive. it occurs usually at nightime, or if i gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. when this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog.  also, besides cough, i do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. the runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, i feel completely normal.  i have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. she adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times. how many days?:reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. as for the runny nose, since november of last year allergies: not that i know of, when i was five years old, i remember being diagnosed of primary complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else.  also, tb runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar).  as for me, 2009 was a stressful year. there were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. also, for a period of time i was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since i stopped. doctor, i would just like to know what are the chances of me, acquiring respiratory illness like pneumonia or tuberculosis, or development of asthma? also, if i get to consult a doctor personally with my parents, will the doctor be able to detect my past smoking habit, based on the procedures he will do, or with tests that he will recommend like xray? the truth is, i am hesitant to go to a medical clinic, because my parents have to accompany me, and i am afraid that the doctor might make "bisto"  towards my parents, as they don't know that i do smoke.  but i do really want to seek medical attention. besides the incovenicence of symtpoms, i am worried that it might be something serious.  hoping for a  share of your brilliant expertise. thank you doctor and good day.
my boyfriend was put in the hospital for strep a nemonia 5 days ago yesterday they done another x ray and said that his nemonia was getting worse and had spread to his left lung and was also in his right real bad they also done a culture on the stuff that hes been coughing up out of his lungs and today they told us he has staph in his lungs how dangerous is this and what should be done

my father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. it was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. only medication is given to help heart. heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. my question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. he moans while asleep. he gets up and sits on bed. he then lays back and the same continues. he states being tired from hospital stay. he states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc.  he really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. then the next night it starts again. has been home since feb. 2. current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. my mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. thanks.

my son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50.  i just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. i hate feelling like i'm always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case. it just seems so quick that a lung issue would be evident, when he only started showing signs of a cold wednesday night.
what is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with levofloxaxin for pneumonia? i just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of iv in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. i entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing i had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom i had visited several days earlier in another hospital. i am 71 years old, female; i had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. should i resume naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. did not take it post hospitalization. do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. thank you.
i have had a percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many dr.s in that time span. i was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. i have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s i also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. i died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. when i was 16 i became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and i became very drug dependent to kill the pain. this lead to my later addictions and no matter what i tried i could not escape their grip.the last time i was in the hospital i said lord i do not know if you are real but if you are i am begging you to open my heart again to you and i need your help or this will probably be it for me when i leave the hospital, i have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life i would not wish the things and amount of death i have had to witness on anyone. i am the last of all my friends left alive and i am 53years old. over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which i grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. i lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until i did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which i found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net

how can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or pertusses in adults. how do you compare? my doc thinks i have pertusses. but the doctor in mexico where i was originally treated said i had pb pneumonia. i was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in mexico before coming home to my dr.here in l.a.the xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  i am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? dr said i will be fine. gave me advair and cough medicine and says i will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  he said i do not need antibiotics because i have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. who do i believe? i am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  i am a strong healthy woman. no immune deficiency or anything like that.

i went to the doctor today and found out that i have pneumonia. i got a steroid injection and breathing treatment in the office and was sent home with levaquin, albuterol, and cough medicine. my forearms and legs are very tingly and almost numb and heavy feeling. is this from the steroid injection? i am 23 years old and i have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so i am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the ra. is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about?
